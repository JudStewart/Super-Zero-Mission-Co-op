# SmzmCoop

An angular project used for the super metroid side. Essentially, connecting to this site on your computer runs the typescript code that connects QUsb2Snes to the python server which handles all of the actual data. This allows you to use QUsb2Snes as opposed to any specific emulator, and makes it easier than having to download a specific script for the game and run it.

Below is the angular pre-generated readme.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
